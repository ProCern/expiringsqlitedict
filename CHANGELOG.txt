Changes
=======
3.0.0, 2022-07-01
* Remove the serializer ABC.
* Use WAL, serialized=NORMAL, and optimize the database on close.
* Allow serializers to use many types, instead of just bytes.
* Allow non-class serializers, like the json module (and other similar modules).
* Change default serializer to json.
* Use cursors for all operation, instead of the implicit db.execute.
* Allow customizing transaction type, defaulting to IMMEDIATE.
* Make a SqliteDict.close method, so the user doesn't have to wait until program
  exit.
* Add a OnDemand, allowing opening a SqliteDict, entering it, and closing
  it in one context manager that is reentrant.  The use of it is the same, but
  it won't open until needed and will immediately close when done with.
