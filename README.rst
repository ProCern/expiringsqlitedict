expiringsqlitedict -- expiring file-backed ``dict``
===================================================

.. _Downloads: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/expiringsqlitedict
.. _License: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/expiringsqlitedict

A lightweight wrapper around Python's sqlite3 database with a MutableMapping
interface::

  from expiringsqlitedict import SqliteDict
  with SqliteDict('./my_db.sqlite') as mydict:
      mydict['some_key'] = any_picklable_object
      print(mydict['some_key'])  # prints the new value
      for key, value in mydict.items():
          print((key, value))
      print(len(mydict)) # etc... all dict functions work

Pickle is used internally by default to serialize the values, and zlib is used
to optionally compress (on insertion, the value is compressed, and it's stored
compressed if the compressed value is smaller than uncompressed). Keys are
arbitrary strings, values arbitrary pickle-able objects.  This must be used
within a context manager, and serialization can be overridden with your own.
The database is wrapped with a transaction, and any exception thrown out of the
context manager rolls back all changes.

This was forked off of `sqlitedict <https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/sqlitedict>`_
in order to add auto-expiring functionality, and initially was quite similar to
it.  Version 2.0 splits of completely and takes the module into a complete
rewrite, mostly to remove unnecesary Ptyhon 2 compatibility, simplify the API,
completely enforce a context manager for typical cases, add full typing
throughout, and use sqlite triggers for expiration cleanup.

This version also does not vacuum at all automatically.  It did in previous
versions, but this was kind of a silly behavior to put into the library itself.
If you want your database file intermittently vacuumed, you should put such
behavior into a crontab or use the ``sqlite3`` module to do it yourself
intermittently.

Features
--------

* Values can be any picklable objects (this can be customized to be as flexible
  as you need, through custom serializers)
* Support for access from multiple programs or threads, with locking fully
  managed by sqlite itself.
* A very simple codebase that is easy to read, relying on sqlite for as much
  behavior as possible.
* A simple autocommit wrapper (``AutocommitSqliteDict``), if you really can't
  handle a context manager and need something that fully handles like a dict.
* Support for custom serialization or compression:

.. code-block:: python

  import json
    
  with SqliteDict('some.db', serializer=json) as mydict:
      mydict['some_key'] = some_json_encodable_object
      print(mydict['some_key'])


Installation
------------

The module has no dependencies beyond Python itself.

Install or upgrade with::

    pip install expiringsqlitedict

or from the `source tar.gz <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/expiringsqlitedict>`_::

    python setup.py install

This module is a single file, so you could also easily import the module in your
own tree, if your workflow needs that.

Testing
-------

You may test this by running ``test.py`` with ``PYTHONPATH`` set to the current
working directory.  There is a convenience makefile to do this for you when you
run:

.. code-block:: sh

  make test

Documentation
-------------

Standard Python document strings are inside the module::

  >>> import expiringsqlitedict
  >>> help(expiringsqlitedict)
